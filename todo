For the density estimation


For the Regression part

1) Make genreg return a row vector. (I think). Just be consistent.

2) epi_trend should be have default values for t_exp, naughty_exp, and 
num_part so that a user can just can just call epi_trend(Data)

3) How to define when partition has outrefined data? 

Concerns:
The essential and the mesh component of the estimation? (from the 
epi-spline paper)

How to use the software:

Generating a trend:
Data should be formatted in an array with the following specs:
	1) Rows are observed data. Columns are organized as follows:
		a) The first column is the "time" index
		b) The last column is the "dependent" variable, 
		   i.e. the variable that we want to predict.
		c) The columns in-between are non-time predictive variables
		   
	Here is an example: 
	We want to constuct a stochastic process that estimates the energy
	consumption for some region. We have some observed data, which 
	we have organized into an array Data, so that
	1) The first column is the hour of the day
	2) The second column is the temperature at that hour
	3) The third column is the humidity at that hour
	4) The fourth column is the observed energy consumption at that hour

We will use the epi_trend function from the ESPE codebase to generate a 
regression surface which uses the time of the day (in hours), temperature,
and humidity, to predict the energy consumption at that hour.

epi-trend returns a function, so the syntax is as follows
reg=epi_trend(Data, t_exp, naughty_exp, num_part)
where
	1) Data is our array
	2) t_exp is the highest exponent in the t variable in the regression
	   surface
	3) naughty_exp (i.e. Not t exponent) is the highest exponent in the 
	   other predictive variables (from our example, that is the temp
	   and humidity
	4) num_part is the number of partitions of the non-time explanatory
	   variables.

Then, the predictions given by our regression for our data is
	reg(Data[:, 1:size(Data,2)-1])
